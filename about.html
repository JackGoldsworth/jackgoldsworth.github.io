            <p>Hello, my name is Jack Goldsworth and I am a Software Engineering student at Iowa State. <br>
                I have been programming since late 2014. I began programming to make Minecraft Servers, and <br>
                then Minecraft Mods. And now I am focused on big platform projects. <br>
                Some of my projects are:</p>
            <h1>Sciens.xyz</h1>
            <p> A Non-profit education platform that I started in 2019. It's in the beginning stages of development.
                <br>
                Find out more about it: <a href="https://github.com/sciens-edu">here</a></p>
            <h1>JurassiCraft</h1>
            <p> A Minecraft mod based on Jurassic Park, that currently sits at 2.7 million downloads. <br>
                I started working on JurassiCraft early 2015, and had an on and off ownership relation between
                2015 and mid 2018.</p>
            <h1>DumbCode</h1>
            <p> A Minecraft modding team that is currently working on several mods, and has around 20 members, <br>
                whether that be programmers or artists. We are aiming to create the best mods in the community.</p>
