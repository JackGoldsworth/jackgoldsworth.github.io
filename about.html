            <p>Hello, my name is Jack Goldsworth and I am a Software Engineering student at Iowa State. <br>
                I have been programming since late 2014. I began programming to make Minecraft Servers, and <br>
                then Minecraft Mods. I am currently working on an education platform, but there is no end in sight <br>
                Some of my big projects are:
            <h1>JurassiCraft</h1>
            <b> A Minecraft mod based on Jurassic Park, that currently sits at 2.7 million downloads. <br>
                I started working on JurassiCraft early 2015, and had an on and off ownership relation between
                2015 and mid 2018.
            </b>
            <h1>DumbCode</h1>
            <b> A Minecraft modding team that is currently working on several mods, and has around 20 members, <br>
                whether that be programmers or artists. We are aiming to create the best mods in the community.
            </b>
